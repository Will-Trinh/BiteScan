# BiteScan 

## A Capstone/Senior Design Project at CSULB

BiteScan helps people and busy households turn grocery receipts into actionable insights. Snap a photo of a receipt, and BiteScan automatically extracts items, quantities, and prices, enriches them with nutrition metadata, and tracks price history across stores. See your spend, calories, macros, and best deals at a glance, so you can eat smarter and save more.
